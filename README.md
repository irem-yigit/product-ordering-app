# Product Ordering App

## Overview
**Product Ordering App** is a microservices-based application developed with **Spring Boot**.  
It demonstrates a modular architecture where each service is responsible for a specific domain:

- **Product Service** → Manages product information and availability.  
- **Transaction Service** → Handles order creation and transaction processes.  
- **API Gateway** → Provides a single entry point to route requests to microservices.  

This project is designed as a learning/demo application to showcase the fundamentals of **microservices architecture**.
